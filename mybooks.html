            <h2 class="ff1-heading"><strong>First Fret One: The Road We Traveled</strong></h2>
                <p>The Road We Traveled is the story of a non-binary former sex worker, Semolina, who has lived many years on disability due to schizoaffective disorder, anxiety, and panic disorders. All she does is write, day and night, and listen to music, dreaming of adventure she fears she’ll never have. When her friends and family enter her in a writing contest without her knowledge, her favorite rockstar, Michael Breathnach, shows up at her door to offer her the winning prize: a chance to travel beside him, as muse, companion, and writer, helping him to make the music that makes her life worthwhile. 
Right away, the two are drawn to each other, but this is a slow burn romance. The tension between them grows and grows until it is unbearable, and delightful carnage results. But their relationship is never easy, and as they stumble along trying to support one another, the line between Michael’s careful protection and dominance of Sem, and his possessiveness and jealousy, blur the lines between budding BDSM-- and full out abuse.
If you enjoy books about unlikely adventurers, rags to riches stories, or stories of difficult relationships, this is the book for you. It is the first book of four, which will all be coming out in the next year.
